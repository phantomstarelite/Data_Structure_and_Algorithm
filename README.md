# ðŸš€ Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Learning & Practice

This repository is my personal journey of learning, practicing, and showcasing **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. I started from the very basics and will gradually move toward advanced concepts, documenting everything along the way. The goal is not only to learn but also to create a structured collection of implementations, explanations, and problem solutions that can help me as well as others who are on the same path.

## ðŸ“˜ About This Repository
DSA is a fundamental skill for every software engineer and is crucial for coding interviews, problem-solving, and competitive programming. Through this repository, I aim to build a strong foundation by implementing each concept from scratch and solving multiple problems related to it.  

The repo includes:
- **Notes** on important concepts explained in simple terms.  
- **Code implementations** of each data structure and algorithm in **C++** (and Python wherever needed).  
- **Problem-solving practice** from platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and Codeforces.  
- **Complexity analysis** for every approach to understand time and space trade-offs.

## ðŸ“‚ Topics Covered
- Basics: Time complexity, recursion, mathematics for programming  
- Arrays and Strings  
- Linked Lists (singly, doubly, circular)  
- Stacks and Queues  
- Trees (binary trees, BST, traversals)  
- Graphs (BFS, DFS, shortest paths, spanning trees)  
- Searching and Sorting algorithms  
- Greedy techniques  
- Dynamic Programming (classic and advanced problems)  
- Miscellaneous patterns and interview problems  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Learn DSA concepts in a structured way.  
- Solve problems regularly to strengthen logical thinking.  
- Prepare for **technical interviews** with solid coding practice.  
- Showcase my growth and progress to recruiters, peers, and the developer community.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **C++** (primary language)  
- **Python** (for practice & explanation)  
- **Markdown** for notes
